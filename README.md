# CNN Image Classifier using Transfer Learning

I have used VGG16 model to classify cats and dogs images downloaded from Kaggle

I have learned this technique from CampusX

1. First notebook contains VGG16 pretrained model without data augmentation and retraining just FC layer.
2. Second notebook is same just data augmentation is applied
3. Third notebook pretrains last block of convolution base of VGG16 model along with FC layer.

Images of cat and dog are downloaded form google and uploaded in these files to predict cat and dog image by our model which predicted them correctly in all three notebooks.
