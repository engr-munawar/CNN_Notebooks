# CNN Image Predictors

I have used VGG16 model to train it on different datasets downloaded from Kaggle

I have learned these technique from CampusX

1. First notebook contains VGG16 pretrained model without data augmentation and retraining just FC layer.
2. Second notebook is same just data augmentation is applied
3. Third notebook pretrains last block of convolution base of VGG16 model along with FC layer.
4. Fourth notebook based on Functional API to predict multi outputs
